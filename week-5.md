## Assesment
This week [**Assessment 1**](/assesments/a1.md) will take place. You can continue working on your prototype for this assesment. In the lab we will focus on code reviewing each other.

#### Preparation

Make sure you come to the assesment prepared in advance:
* Have a look at the [rubic](/assesments/a1.md) and **grade yourself**. Bring the filled in rubic to the oral test.
* Check out the [checklist](/assesments/a1.md) below the rubic. Did you forget anything?

Presenting your work is a skill all by itself, make sure you prepare yourself properly. The best way is to treat it as [public speaking](https://abookapart.com/products/demystifying-public-speaking) and there are [many books](https://be.noti.st/2018/recommended-books-for-public-speakers) on public speaking available.
* Bring your own computer and a charger.
* Have the latest version of your code ready in your editor.
* Open up your docs inside of your GitHub repository.
* Have a live version up and running.
